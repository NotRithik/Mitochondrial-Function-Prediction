tips: 

One of the most imporatnt parts in data analysis is experience in working with different datasets

Organizing a workshop where the students are taught basic techniques in data analysis, such as plotting graphs, regression, and using ideas like mean, mode, median, to create interpretable results. 

Have a crash course on the most important topics, such as basic linear algebra, what is the goal of data analyses, drawing meaningful conclusions from data, etc. 

Have a mock project which is very short, so that they gain experience doing these operations. As a  mock project is the best way to learn 

The most imp thing for data driven things is practice, and experience in the programming language/software you are using. So crash courses on that can help or workshops. 

Talking with peers who have the same ideas and such can be very helpful as well, so group the environmental-data ppl together and have them work together to figure stuff out, and the econ-data ppl in another group etc. 

Many of them have learned several concepts, like the Grahm Scmitt, but haven't used it. You can focus on actually using topics that you have learned before now.
